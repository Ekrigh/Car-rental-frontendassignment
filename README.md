First javascript project outside of udemycourses.
School project to build a simple frontend ui to an already existing backend supplied by the school.
main purpose is for us to practise fetching endpoints and doing standard crudoperations in the frontend.

not allowed to use any frameworks.
Some attributes coming from the backend isnt used as the backendlogic isnt complete, rendering them useless. For example isActive on orders, noOfOrders on customers.
backend hardcodes all cars to maximum 3 features.
no checkout functionality, no security added (basic security, holding userinfo as base 64 in session storage during development)
